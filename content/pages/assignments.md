Rivkin, Jan W., and Michael E. Porter. "Matching DELL™." Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Case 9-799-158, June 06, 1999.

Ghemawat, Pankaj, and Jan W. Rivkin. "Creating Competitive Advantage." Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Case 9-798-062, January 25, 1998.

### Questions for Discussion

i. How and why did the personal computer industry come to have such low average profitability?

ii. Why has DELL™ been so successful?

iii. Prior to the recent efforts by competitors to match DELL™ (1997-1998), how big was DELL™'s competitive advantage? Specifically, calculate DELL™'s advantage over Compaq in serving a corporate customer.

iv. How effective have competitors been in responding to the challenge posed by DELL™'s advantage? How big is DELL™'s remaining advantage?

DELL™ is properly being presented as one of the most innovative companies, the creator of a business model that has received a great deal of attention in the networked economy. Questions i. and ii. can be addressed using Porter's Five Forces and Porter's Value Chain frameworks respectively. The third question allows for you to do some numerical calculations to quantify DELL™'s advantage over Compaq. You are welcome to work in groups in preparation of this analysis.

Corts, Kenneth S., and Jan W. Rivkin. "A Note on Microeconomics for Strategists." Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Case 9-799-128. March 30, 1999.

### Questions for Discussion

i. Based on your own experience of traditional bookselling and your exploration of online bookselling, compare willingness-to-pay for books supplied by these two business models.

ii. Also compare the forecast long-run cost position of a successful online bookseller to Barnes & Noble's traditional business model. (Assume that Exhibits 4 and 7 in the case reflect average discounts of 10% off list price for Barnes & Noble's traditional bookstores and 25% off list for the online bookseller.)

iii. Assess Barnes & Noble's response to the substitution threat from AMAZON®. How did AMAZON® respond in turn, and to what net effect?

iv. Who will be the online leader? Will it ever make much money selling books (as opposed to selling stock)?

Please contrast the competitive positioning of a traditional, off-line, competitor like Barnes & Noble vs. an on-line channel like [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/). With regard to question i., a customer willingness to pay for a product or a service is the maximum amount of money a customer is willing to part with in order to obtain a product or a service. The question is whether you find any significant difference in your willingness to pay for a book being acquired under these two different channels. In question ii. You might want to use the most recent data provided in Exhibit 4 (1996 for Barnes and Noble) and Exhibit 7 (F2001E for AMAZON®). Remember that Barnes & Noble provides 10% discount off list price, and AMAZON® provides 25%. The case is a good vehicle also to talk about the substitution threat Barnes & Noble and how it is responding against AMAZON®.

Aguilar, Francis J., and Arvind Bhambri. "Johnson & Johnson (A)." Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Case 9-384-053, August 19, 1983.

Aguilar, Francis J., and Arvind Bhambri. "Johnson & Johnson (B): Hospital Services." Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Case 9-384-054, August 19, 1983.

### Questions for Discussion

(Johnson & Johnson (A))

i. Comment on Johnson & Johnson (J&J) philosophy and culture. Are they overdoing their decentralization policy? What is your opinion about "The Credo?"

ii. How are strategic and operational responsibilities handled at J&J? Do you like their strategic planning process and their executive compensation?

(Johnson & Johnson (B): Hospital Services)

iii. By establishing the Hospital Services Group (HSG), J&J seems to be taking an action against the fiber of its decentralization philosophy and culture. Do you agree with that decision?

iv. Comment on the charter of HSG. How would you prevent possible conflicts between HSG and the J&J companies?

Although these cases on the surface are quite old, they address some very critical issues that have profound relevance in management regardless of time. The A case presents a company that is enormously consistent in terms of its culture, management processes, and philosophy. Decentralization is the trademark of that organization. Case B deeply challenges the effectiveness of this management structure. I have two very interesting tapes of Jim Burke, who was CEO of Johnson & Johnson at that time that I would like for you to see.

Bartlett, Christopher A. "McKinsey and Company: Managing Knowledge and Learning." Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Case 9-396-357. June 28, 1996

### Questions for Discussion

i. How was the obscure little firm of "accounting and engineering advisors" able to grow into the world's most prestigious consulting firm fifty years later? What was the unique source of competitive advantage developed by James O. McKinsey and later Marvin Bower?

ii. How effective was Ron Daniel in leading McKinsey to respond to challenges identified in the Commission on Firm Aims and Goals? What contribution did Fred Gluck make to the required changes?

iii. Judging by the evidence in the three mini-cases of front-line activities in the mid-1990s, how effective has the firm been in its two-decade long change process?

What is your evaluation of Rajat Gupta's "four-pronged" approach to knowledge development and application within McKinsey? As a senior partner, what specific advice would you give him?

### Questions for Discussion

i. How difficult a challenge did Welch face in 1981? How effectively did he take charge?

ii. What is Welch's objective in the series of initiatives he launched in the late 1980s and early 1990s? What is he trying to achieve in the round of changes he put in motion in that period? Is there a logic or rationale supporting the change process?

iii. How does such a large, complex diversified conglomerate defy the critics and continue to grow so profitably? Have Welch's various initiatives added value? If so, how?

iv. What is your evaluation of Welch's approach to leading change? How important is he to GE's success? What implications for his replacement?
