### Independent Research Project

30% of the final grade will be for an individual (**not** a group) paper, due on or before Ses #18. You are welcome to review your topic with me during the semester.

The format of the paper should be text, exhibits, and a bibliography of sources used. The paper should be no more than 15 double-spaced pages of text and 10 exhibits, excluding the bibliography. Length is not a virtue and students should "spend the time to make the document shorter."

The paper should provide you with an opportunity to illustrate the application of one of the frameworks we developed in class to an industry or firm of your choice.

### Cases

Three cases write-ups are required. In essence, your paper should demonstrate that you have carefully analyzed the case, and have a coherent view on how the company should proceed. Be clear and concise. Your writing style has an important impact on your ability to communicate your ideas. Case discussions should be about 3 pages, double-spaced, excluding exhibits. In guiding the case analyses you can follow the questions that are given for each case in the {{% resource_link 097a3c4f-c990-6c43-cd2f-6ff61b024c61 "assignments" %}} section.

### Class Participation

Your active participation in the discussion in class is considered very important in this course. Prior preparation of the cases and assigned readings are essential. By making 25% of your grade dependent on your participation in class we hope to encourage you to feel responsible in making this course work. Class attendance is required.
